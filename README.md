Compiling
---------

If you have SCons installed, simply cd to the project root and run

    scons

If, instead, you don't have SCons, there is a Makefile available that will fetch a user-space installation and run it: run it by calling

    make

Running
-------
Simply start with

    ./scheduletrace
